# Terms of Service for FinTrack

**Effective Date: October 26, 2023**

By downloading or using the FinTrack app, these terms will automatically apply to you. You should make sure that you read them carefully before using the app.

## 1. Use of the App
FinTrack provides a tool for personal finance management by analyzing SMS messages. The app is for personal, non-commercial use only.

## 2. Accuracy of Data
FinTrack uses automated algorithms (regex patterns) to parse SMS messages. While we strive for 100% accuracy, we cannot guarantee that every transaction will be parsed correctly. Users should not rely solely on the app for critical financial decisions or tax reporting.

By using the SMS parsing feature you acknowledge that:
- SMS parsing is an automated feature that may misclassify or omit transactions.
- You consent to on-device analysis of your SMS messages for the purpose of extracting transaction information.
- You are responsible for reviewing parsed transactions for accuracy and for retaining original SMS messages if needed for official records.

## 3. Privacy
Your use of the app is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains how we handle your SMS data locally on your device.

## 4. Prohibited Actions
You agree not to:
- Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer the app.
- Use the app for any illegal financial tracking or fraudulent purposes.
- Interfere with the app's security features.

<!-- Diagnostics and support logging details removed per request -->

## 5. Limitation of Liability
FinTrack and its developers shall not be liable for any financial loss, data loss, or indirect damages resulting from the use or inability to use the app, including but not limited to incorrect parsing of financial transactions.

## 6. Modifications to Service
We reserve the right to modify or withdraw the service at any time without notice.

## 7. Termination
We may terminate your access to the app if you violate these terms.
