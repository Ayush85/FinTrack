# Privacy Policy for FinTrack

**Last Updated: October 26, 2023**

FinTrack ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Information We Collect

### SMS Data (Sensitive Permission)
FinTrack requires access to your SMS messages to provide its core functionality.
- **What we access**: We read incoming and existing SMS messages from banks, financial institutions, and service providers.
- **What we extract**: We only extract transaction-related data such as amount, date, currency, and merchant/bank name.
- **Local Processing**: **All SMS processing is done locally on your device.** Your raw SMS messages and extracted transaction data are never uploaded to our servers, sold to third parties, or shared with anyone else.

<!-- Logging and diagnostics details removed per request -->

### Device Information
We may collect basic device information (model, OS version) for the purpose of debugging and improving app performance.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the data extracted from your SMS to:
- Generate spending and earning reports.
- Categorize your transactions (e.g., Wallet Load, Mobile Recharge).
- Provide daily, weekly, and monthly financial summaries.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
- **Local Storage**: All your financial data is stored locally on your device.
- **No Cloud Sync**: We do not provide cloud synchronization; if you delete the app or clear its data, your transaction history within the app will be lost.
- **Security**: Since data remains on-device, its security is tied to your device's security settings.

## 4. Third-Party Services
FinTrack does not share any personal or financial data with third-party services. The app does not contain ads or tracking SDKs that transmit your financial behavior.

## 5. Permissions
- **READ_SMS**: Required to analyze transaction alerts.
- **INTERNET**: Used only for fetching static UI assets (icons/logos) and app updates. No financial data is transmitted over the internet.

## 6. Your Rights
You can revoke SMS permissions at any time through your device settings. However, doing so will prevent the app from tracking new transactions.

If you revoke permission or uninstall the app, extracted transaction data stored in the app will be removed from the device. If you would like us to delete any server-side data (if you have explicitly opted into any backup feature), contact us at the address below.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
